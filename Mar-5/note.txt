variables : Variable is reserved memory block, Which is also known as Name of container which is reponsible for storing data inside in it..
But we also know that python is object oritend programming so it has reference object or references.

source code :
x = 10
print(x)
print(type(x))
x = 10.5
print(x)
print(type(x))
------------------------------------------------------------------------
output :
10
<class 'int'>
10.5
<class 'float'>



Data types : Data types is a type of data  store in memory block 
	1. mutable : 
		a.dict 
		b.set 
		c.list
		
		source code : 
		student =["Vedant","Mansh"]
		print(student)
		student.remove("Mansh")
		print(student)
		
		output :
		['Vedant', 'Mansh']
		['Vedant']

	2. immutable : 
		a. numeric
				i. int 
				ii.float
				iii. complex 
				iv. boolean
				v. none
		b. string 
		c. tuple
		source code:		
		student =("Vedant","Mansh")
		print(student)
		student[1] = "Akash"
